# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
#
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
  # Make sure your code looks nice so that people can read it.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
  # Define your variables and functions clearly. Don't make people or programs assume anything.
# Simple is better than complex.
  # Complex code takes longer to run. Use faster methods whenever possible.
# Complex is better than complicated.
  # Something that takes longer to run is better than an unintelligible formula.
# Flat is better than nested.
  # Don't nest loops so far that they're a whole screen to the right. If your code is that complicated, it should be rewritten.
# Sparse is better than dense.
  # Space your code out so that it's readable. Don't cramEverythingIntoOneSingleLine like that. Put whitespace between lines.
# Readability counts.
  # If you can't understand your code, how can you fix it? How can anyone else understand it, either?
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  # I'm not entirely sure what a special case is, but the point here is to stick to the formula, even if it's a bit redundant.
# Although practicality beats purity.
  # Use coding to your advantage. Don't follow the letter of the law, but the spirit.
# Errors should never pass silently.
  # If something breaks, it should be obvious that it broke.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
  # "It's not a bug, it's a feature!"
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  # Your code should be understandable. If it isn't, make it understandable. Don't make people guess your intent.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  # Though there may be an obvious way, it may not be the only way. Just the most convenient or common.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  # this line's just funny :D
# Now is better than never.
  # Don't put off work because you feel like you aren't ready.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
  # At the same time, you need to be prepared for what you're trying to do.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  # If you can't understand your idea, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  # But if you can, and everyone else understands it, it may be worth a try!
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
  # I'm not sure what namespaces are. But it's clear that if an idea is good, let's do it more often!
